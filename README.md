The BMI scale, which computes a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, aims to measure tissue mass. It is frequently used as a broad indicator of a person's healthy body weight for height. In particular, depending on which range the number falls within, the BMI value is used to classify a person as being underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. These BMI ranges fluctuate depending on factors like geography and age, and they are occasionally further broken down into subcategories like severely underweight or very severely obese. BMI is a weak indicator of a healthy body weight, but it is a useful tool for determining whether a person is overweight or underweight, which can have serious health consequences.It is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required.
